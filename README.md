A public API for the web app, and mobile apps to consume.

## Welcome

If you are reading this, thanks for stopping by. You may be familiar with the [Redadalertas](http://github.com/cosecha/redadalertas) project.

This project is part of that. This repo will house the code to make the public facing API.

## TODO

- Write out documentation
